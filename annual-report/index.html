                    <h2>Project Details</h2>
                    <p>This project was a major part of my internship at the Kapi'olani Commmunity College Office of the Chancellor.
                    The project entailed designing the cover for the annual report, which covers events, news and statistics for the 2018-2019 academic year.

                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>As this was a campus project, the process started with coming up with themes and words to describe the year.
                        The initial ideas for focus that I had included the succulent garden, the great lawn, and the plants that are cared for by college botany professors.
                        After disscussions with my supervisors, we decided to narrow our focus down onto the a'ali'i, a native Hawaiian plant that is known to be strong and resilient. 
                        Once an idea was decided on, the next step was research. I interviewed the botany professor to learn about the plants we have on campus. 
                        Next, in the illustration process, I had 2 different versions of the a'ali'i in different styles. 
                        The first style was pixelated using a fuzzy brush in Adobe Photoshop and the second used vector shapes in Adobe Illustrator.
                        After consulting with my supervisors, they advised me to go with the vector style. So for the next week I began polishing the illustration. </p>
